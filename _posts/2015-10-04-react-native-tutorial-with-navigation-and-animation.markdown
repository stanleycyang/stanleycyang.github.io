##React Native

[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) is a framework created by [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) that allows programmers build **native** iOS application with JavaScript. 

If you take a quick peek at the source code of React Native, you will notice that a lot of it is actually written in Objective-C! This is great because:

- With React Native, your application business logic is written and run in JavaScript while keeping the UI (User Interface) completely native. Therefore, there is no compromises typically associated with HTML5 UI

- React is a completely new approach to building extremely performant web applications with emphasis on the **V** in [**MVC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)

React Native aims to bring the power of React to mobile app development. Once you learn the basics, you can create magnificient web / mobile applications that users will love.

##Tutorial Scope

We will be building an iOS application in this tutorial. However, once you learn the concepts you can transfer it into making an Android application very Swift-ly (ha-ha).
